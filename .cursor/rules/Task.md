# TASK.md - Mobile Version Optimization for sfocra.com

## Objective
Fix the layout issues on the mobile version of https://sfocra.com/ and ensure a fully responsive, user-friendly experience across mobile devices.

## Tasks

### 1. Initial Assessment
- [ ] Open https://sfocra.com/ on a mobile device or browser emulator (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
- [ ] Identify specific layout issues (e.g., overflowing content, misaligned elements, unreadable text, unresponsive buttons, general layout breakage).
- [ ] Take screenshots of problem areas for reference.
- [ ] Check the existing CSS for media queries or responsive design patterns.

### 2. Setup and Planning
- [ ] Create a branch in the repository (e.g., `mobile-optimization`).
- [ ] Review the current React component structure to identify key components affecting layout (e.g., header, footer, main content).
- [ ] Decide on a mobile-first or desktop-first approach (recommend mobile-first for simplicity).
- [ ] Define target screen sizes for testing (e.g., focusing on the 320px to 768px range, with specific checks at 320px, 375px, and 768px).

### 3. CSS and Styling Fixes
- [ ] Add or update media queries in the CSS files (e.g., `responsive.css`, `App.css`, or component-specific styles).
  - Example breakpoints:
    - Small screens: `@media (max-width: 768px)` (Adjust based on design needs)
    - Very small screens: `@media (max-width: 576px)` (Adjust based on design needs)
- [ ] Fix text sizing and spacing:
  - [ ] Ensure font sizes are legible (e.g., minimum 16px).
  - [ ] Adjust padding and margins for smaller screens to prevent crowding.
- [ ] Address layout overflow and alignment:
  - [ ] Use `overflow-x: hidden;` on appropriate containers if needed.
  - [ ] Convert fixed-width elements to relative units (e.g., `%`, `vw`, `rem`) or use `max-width: 100%;`.
  - [ ] Adjust flexbox/grid properties for vertical stacking (`flex-direction: column`, adjust grid templates).
- [ ] Optimize images:
  - [ ] Ensure images scale properly using `max-width: 100%`.
  - [ ] Consider lazy loading for performance.

### 4. Component Adjustments
- [ ] Update the navigation bar:
  - [ ] Collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile (if not already implemented).
  - [ ] Ensure menu items are tappable (minimum 48px touch target).
- [ ] Fix main content layout:
  - [ ] Stack elements vertically using flexbox (`flex-direction: column`).
  - [ ] Adjust grid layouts to single-column if applicable.
- [ ] Update footer:
  - [ ] Ensure footer content fits without overlap or excessive scrolling.

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test on multiple mobile screen sizes using browser tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools responsive mode).
- [ ] Test on a physical mobile device if possible.
- [ ] Verify interactivity (e.g., buttons, links) works with touch inputs.
- [ ] Check performance (e.g., Lighthouse score) and optimize if needed.

### 6. Finalization
- [ ] Review changes against desktop version to ensure no regressions.
- [ ] Commit and push changes to the `mobile-optimization` branch.
- [ ] Create a pull request for review.
- [ ] Deploy to a staging environment and verify fixes on https://sfocra.com/.
- [ ] Merge into the main branch and deploy to production.

## Notes
- Prioritize critical layout issues first (e.g., content not visible, broken navigation).
- Use tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, or BrowserStack for testing.
- Document any trade-offs or unresolved issues for future iterations.
